The black curve indicates the region where the bound becomes trivial. Below this line, the probability is bounded by 1. Darker colors indicate lower probability of the ``bad'' event --- that the difference in risks exceeds $\epsilon $. The colors correspond to the natural logarithm of the bound on this probability.}}{50}{figure.4}
